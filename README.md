# Applied Data Science - University of Michigan

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Applied Data Science** program offered by the University of Michigan. This repository documents my journey and learning through the program, covering essential topics in data science, data visualization, machine learning, text mining, and social network analysis. The content and projects in this repository are based on hands-on coursework, coding exercises, and practical applications of the data science toolkit using Python.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course modules, each reflecting a different part of the Applied Data Science program:

1. **Introduction to Data Science with Python**  
   Fundamentals of data science, covering Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, as well as foundational concepts like data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.

2. **Applied Charting and Visualization with Python**  
   Techniques for effective data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Emphasis is on storytelling with data and creating insightful visualizations.

3. **Applied Machine Learning in Python**  
   Practical approaches to machine learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning models, feature engineering, and model evaluation using Scikit-Learn.

4. **Applied Text Mining in Python**  
   Hands-on exploration of text mining, covering natural language processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling using NLTK and SpaCy.

5. **Applied Social Network Analysis in Python**  
   Insights into social network analysis, including graph theory, network structure, centrality measures, and community detection using NetworkX.

Each module folder contains:
- **Lecture Notes & Exercises**: Summaries of key concepts covered in each module.
- **Projects**: Practical assignments and projects that apply course concepts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Python code and analysis presented in an interactive, step-by-step format.

## üîß Prerequisites
